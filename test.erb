Some text before non-instance variables, one of which has non-word characters in 
it:

<%= variable1 %><%= other_variable2 %>

Additional text before an instance variable which must not be modified:

<%= @instance_variable %>

A loop, which also needs to be converted:

<% all_addresses_ipv4.each do |address| -%>
  allow <%= @address %>
  allow <%= address %>
<% end -%>

A variable padded with space:

  <%= variable4 %>

These two variables (<%= variable5 %><%= variable6 %>) are between text.
